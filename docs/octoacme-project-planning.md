# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Cross-Role Collaboration

### Planning Workshop Activities
Effective planning requires coordinated input from multiple roles:

**Requirements Alignment (Product Manager, Business Analyst, UX Designer):**
- Conduct joint requirement workshops to ensure business needs align with user experience
- Review and refine acceptance criteria together
- Validate that requirements are clear, complete, and testable

**Technical Feasibility Review (Technical Lead, Developers, UX Designer):**
- Evaluate design feasibility and implementation approach
- Identify technical constraints that may affect design or scope
- Agree on architectural patterns and coding standards
- Discuss performance, security, and scalability considerations

**Dependency Mapping (Project Manager, Scrum Master, Technical Lead):**
- Identify cross-team and external dependencies
- Create dependency board or diagram
- Establish communication channels with dependent teams
- Define handoff points and integration milestones

**Capacity Planning (Scrum Master, Project Manager, Technical Lead):**
- Review team availability and skills
- Identify skill gaps or training needs
- Plan for planned absences and buffer time
- Align on realistic sprint commitments

### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Coordination**: Scrum Master facilitates standup; Project Manager escalates blockers
- **Weekly Sync**: Product Manager, Project Manager, and Technical Lead align on progress and priorities
- **Sprint Boundaries**: All roles participate in planning, review, and retrospective
- **Ad-hoc Clarifications**: Business Analyst and UX Designer available for developer questions

### Decision-Making Framework
- **Product Scope**: Product Manager decides with input from Business Analyst and stakeholders
- **Technical Approach**: Technical Lead decides with input from Developers
- **Schedule/Resources**: Team self-organizes around capacity; Scrum Master facilitates; Project Manager coordinates external dependencies and communicates constraints
- **User Experience**: UX Designer decides with validation from Product Manager and users
- **Process Improvements**: Scrum Master facilitates team decision-making
