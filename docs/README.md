# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This README provides a concise summary of our project management approach and includes quick links to all key process resources.

## Project Management Processes Summary
- **Customer-first:** Projects focus on customer value and usability.
- **Iterative delivery:** Work is delivered in small, testable increments (sprints, milestones).
- **Clear ownership:** Each project is led by a Project Manager and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed decisions:** Success is measured and processes are improved based on evidence.
- **Safety and feedback:** We foster psychological safety and encourage continuous improvement.
